**Fried Display:**

Not all Chinese 4 pin I2c displays are the same. Their power pins may be switched compared to similar displays. 
The display in this picture underwent reverse voltage for a few seconds... Still works somewhat, but is very very dim. 


**Not like the others:**

Most cheap Wifi adapters (under $3 USD) worked fine with the raspberry pi in my exeperience. However, I ordered 2 
adapters from China that ended up being duds. They would work for a brief amount of time, and then quickly overheat and stop responding. 
In a desktop computer it would last a little longer (half day, then slowly went down to a few minutes, to seconds). Please thoroughly test all 
Wifi adapters before soldering or integrating it into a hueBerry as you may get a dud.
